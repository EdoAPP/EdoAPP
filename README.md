<!-- ### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=EdoAPP.EdoAPP) -->

<!-- I am a full-stack software engineer. I love programming, working out and self-growth stuff. Currently grinding to become an artist.

As a software engineer, I love building things, translate ideas into products that make a change. That's been my motivation through this software engineering journey.
